Though many critics thought that Chicago Hope had a better chance for survival than ER, the NBC series scored a surprise hit -- and over a decade later it was still firmly imbedded in the network's Thursday-night schedule, while Chicago Hope had long since vanished. Set largely in the emergency room of Chicago's fictional County General Hospital, ER focused on the professional and personal trials and tribulations of the unit's staff, with several subplots and story arcs weaving in and out of each hour-long episode. The regular cast for the first season consisted of Anthony Edwards as Dr. Mark Greene, George Clooney as Dr. Doug Ross, Sherry Stringfield as Dr. Susan Lewis, Eriq La Salle as Dr. Peter Benton, Julianna Margulies as Head Nurse Carol Hathaway, and Noah Wyle as med student (and later doctor) John Carter. Of these actors, only Sherry Stringfield and Noah Wyle would still be on the series as it entered its second decade on the air -- and of these two, only Wyle had been on the show throughout its entire run (Stringfield retired from the series in season three, but returned five years later). Later principals, in order of their appearance, included Laura Innes as Dr. Kerry Weaver, Alex Kingston as Dr. Elizabeth Corday, Paul McCrane as Dr. Robert Romano, Kellie Martin as med student Lucy Knight, Erik Palladino as Dr. Dave Malucci, Goran Visnjic as Dr. Luka Kovac, Ming-Na as Dr. Jing-Mei \"Deb\" Chen (a recurring character in season one who returned as a regular in season six), Maura Tierney as Nurse (and later Dr.) Abby Lockhart, Michael Michele as Dr. Cleo Finch, Sharif Atkins as Dr. Michael Gallant, Mekhi Phifer as Dr. Gregory Pratt, and Parminder Nagra as med student (and later doctor) Neela Rasgotra. Many of these characters' lives were intertwined romantically, while some of the characters were bitter enemies; all were uniformly fascinating. And just as in \"real life,\" there was nothing predictable about the exits of certain characters: some departed with tragic abruptness (Lucy Knight, Robert Romano), others simply bade farewell and moved on with their lives (Doug Ross, Carol Hathaway, Peter Benton); but no \"goodbye\" was as poignant and moving as the lingering illness and death of Mark Greene throughout the length and breadth of season eight. Though the plot emphasis was on the continuing characters, a number of prominent guest stars made memorable appearances during the series' decade-plus run. Alan Alda, Sally Field, and Bob Newhart were but three of the A-list entertainers who passed in and out of the doors of Chicago County. The winner of innumerable industry awards, ER has also earned a niche in media history as the most expensive dramatic series in TV history, reaching this particular plateau with its 13-million-dollar-per-episode average budget during the 1998-1999 season.

In the Northwest, many credible people swear to have sighted Bigfoot. Near Lake Champlain, locals have sworn up and down to seeing a strange, prehistoric-like creature in the water. And down south in the swamplands, it's no different-some of the most deep-rooted and fearsome monster stories have endured. In the new original series Cryptid: The Swamp Beast, one of America's oldest mysteries and bone-chilling legends comes to life through dramatizations, eyewitness accounts, real news reports and expert interviews. In a remote southern town, the past few years have brought a dramatic uptick in strange occurrences, but now, whatever has been lurking in the swamps is intruding into human territory. There have been a rash of cattle mutilations and pets being snatched away from backyards. With the attacks not matching up forensically with any known predators, suspicions have spread. Terrified residents claim to have seen signs of voodoo and are conjuring up old Cajun legends like the \"Rougarou,\" a mythical shape-shifter, as a possible culprit. Others swear they've seen a huge, bipedal creature locally known as a \"skunk ape\" lurking about at night. The series follows a small animal-control business that responds to various calls and sightings and a deputy sheriff who believes the real culprit is some twisted individual deep in the swamp. As the weeks pass, the sightings intensify and even the most skeptical people in town begin to wonder if its darkest legends, and their worst fears, have in fact come to life. Cryptid: The Swamp Beast mixes legends with eyewitness accounts and crafts them into an entertaining and scary fictional story that speaks to America's macabre history of folklore. It features startling real interviews with those who believe the legends, and have seen strange things with their own eyes. Folklore experts, biologists and original news clips play throughout each episode as well to add further real-world context.", "imdb_id": "tt3552654", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/17449-4492714005-3396338835-15541735-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 17449, "title": "Cryptid: The Swamp Beast", "first_aired": "2014-02-24", "runtime": "60"}, {"status": null, "rating": "TV-14", "overview": "A group of assasins are controled by Chronos.

Eventually, the film crew discerned the ebb and flow of life on a carrier, and began to feel more at home on board. The ship's crew not only accepted them but also took a vested interest in the project, making suggestions on the best places to film and providing access to missions that helped capture the full experience of the deployment. Jammed into their own staterooms, the crew that once felt apart now felt kinship as they shared both trepidation and jubliation awaiting the safe return of the carrier's jet fighters. When the huge emotional surge of seeing home hit in November, the filmmakers knew how the Nimitz crew must feel.

The cameras unearth the crisis and revelation, heartbreak and heroism of these inner city cops--moments of raw exposure when they address us directly, as well as private moments when they forget they're being filmed. There's the damaged but driven Detective Louis Fitch, a wily homicide vet who is the most respected--and most misunderstood--man in the division; Detective Damon Washington, Fitch's new partner, who finds the first day on the job is a trial by fire, complicated by the imminent birth of his first child; Detective Ariana Sanchez, sexy, edgy and beautiful, who has emerged from a rough background to become a rising star in the department; Narcotics undercover cop John Stone, a streetwise smooth talker, clever and quick with a smile made for the movies, who is teamed with Sanchez--a combustible pairing rife with conflict and sexual tension; Sergeant Jesse Longford, a 30-year veteran struggling with his impending retirement from the force and the city he loves, who, together with his partner, Detective Aman Mahajan--a fully Americanized son of Indian immigrants--form an amusing mismatch of experience and enthusiasm, intellect and instinct, old school and new world, but whose combined skills have never encountered a case that couldn't be cleared; and all are headed by Lieutenant Maureen Mason, a strong-willed single mom struggling to balance home and work.

Of this close-knit group of friends, everyone else has paired off, while Brian has emerged as the last bachelor standing. At 34, regardless of his run of bad luck in matters of the heart, Brian still holds out hope that one day he'll open the door and be blinded by love. However questions about his fate have been popping up more frequently in his head. The most pressing question is - and it's one that only he can answer -- could all of his problems stem from the fact that he is harboring a crush on the picture-perfect Marjorie, his best friend's girl? Adam, Brian's best friend since childhood, was going to break up with Marjorie but found himself proposing to her instead. He's a lawyer and Marjorie is a pediatric surgeon. Their busy lifestyles leave them little time to plan their upcoming wedding and, oddly enough, that seems to have given them more time to re-evaluate whether they're indeed doing the right thing. Brian's fortysomething sister, Nic, and her boy-toy husband, Angelo, are trying hard to start a family, but something's not right. Nic's high-stress work as a record executive and Angelo's fledgling acting career have created some anxiety in the new marriage. Now they're torn between conceiving a child the old-fashioned way or using modern medicine to speed up the process. Dave, who runs a video game business with Brian called Zap Monkey, is married to stay-at-home mom Deena. They've been together for 13 years, have three little girls and a lackluster sex life.

The film made a huge impact - showcasing the radical and effective juvenile intervention program that took place in a New Jersey prison. Since they were created, both the prison program and the film have turned countless kids away from drugs, violence and crime. The power of the original \"Scared Straight!\" program has inspired dozens of inmate-run intervention programs in men's and women's prisons across the country; and this series will showcase several of them. Under the auspices of Arnold Shapiro, \"Beyond Scared Straight\" profiles the new approach to keeping today's kids from becoming tomorrow's convicts. Much like the original version of \"Scared Straight!,\" these youthful offender programs put boys and girls of all ethnicities, ranging in age from 13-18, into intensive one-day in-prison sessions that show them the realities of life behind bars. However, in many dramatic ways, these 21st Century programs are very different from the original because today's youth needs a different approach. For current teens, city streets can be as dangerous as the life they believe exists behind bars. TV, film and music have glorified the gang and prison experience and the task of \"scaring\" teens is more complicated now than ever. As a result, inmates have had to adapt their methods - making them more a combination of intimidation, information and communication - and the results for the new program have proven to be equally effective. Each 60-minute episode of \"Beyond Scared Straight\" will focus on a different prison program in the U.S., following 4 -5 at-risk teens.

The series is bound to win a whole new and well-deserved audience for Wodehouse, the great comic writer whose dates were 1881-1975. He has a host of fans, not least among them, writers and actors like Stephen Fry and Simon Callow, and indeed our own Marian Keyes. Marian declares him to be \"the ultimate in comfort reading, because nothing bad ever happens in PG Wodehouse's land.\"  In the Blandings series, Emsworth struggles to keep his dysfunctional family in order but usually confuses things himself. All he wants is to be left in peace with his beloved pig The Empress, but friends, visitors, servants and spongers get in the way. Jennifer Saunders stars as his indomitable sister Connie, Jack Farthing as hapless son Freddy and Mark Williams as long-suffering butler Beach. There are guest appearances from David Walliams, Paloma Faith and David Bamber. The show was filmed at 400-year-old Crom Castle, near Newtownbutler in Northern Ireland, home of Lord Erne. There have been some spiffing PG Wodehouse series in the past, yet his achingly funny Blandings stories have been mostly overlooked. This high-spirited adaptation see Timothy Spall as fuddle-headed pig-fancier Lord Emsworth and Jennifer Saunders as his terrifying sister Lady Constance.

Set in far from glamorous Willesden Green, London from the 1970s to the 1990s, White Teeth finds Archie Jones, interracially married to the post-Jehovah s Witness Clara, meeting up with an old colleague, Samad Iqbal who, with his family, has just arrived in England. The secrets they share from the past, and the secrets they will share in the future, are tossed and tumbled in a rich stew that bubbles with racial and sexual tension, new-found freedoms, old school politics, genetic science, animal liberation and the end of the world as we know it. It all adds up to a feast to be relished from start to finish. First broadcast on Channel 4 in 2002 and skillfully adapted by Simon Burke from the acclaimed novel by Zadie Smith, White Teeth is a colourful, decades-spanning chunk of recent history filtered through the lives of a small group of individuals. It begins with unhappy war veteran Archie Jones (Phil Davis, Bleak House, Sherlock) preparing to end his life in Willesden, London, 1974. A man whose most important decisions rest on the toss of a coin, Archie's doleful fatalism illustrates both White Teeth's rich seam of bleak humour and its reliance on fate and coincidence to propel the plot. The black comedy carries into the dialogue and the performances, as well as moments of absurd slapstick - watch out for Archie's description of his first marriage, made all the funnier by Davis' hangdog, deadpan performance. This exchange takes place during the first episode, in which he reconnects with an old army friend, Samad Iqbal (Om Puri, East is East, Charlie Wilson's War). Samad, a blustering bon-vivant and pseudo intellectual, arrives in Willesden to fulfill an arranged marriage to a steely young bride (an eye-catching Archie Punjabi, East is East, The Good Wife). Samad finds England less welcoming than he'd hoped, as do Clara Bowden and her redoubtable mother. Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, 28 Days Later) imbues Clara with a combination of innocence and easy, instinctive sensuality, as she begins to leave her mother's inflexible world view behind. Clara's self-discovery leads her to a brief affair and an encounter with a commune, featuring a relatively subdued, but perfectly cast Russell Brand. In one of a number of leaps back and forth through time, the second episode opens in 1984, which finds Samad and Archie neighbours with young families. Snubbed by his resentful wife, Samad allows himself to be led astray by a personable, dippy teacher at his sons' school. The affair, deliberately the stuff of midlife crisis cliche, allows director Julian Jarrold to convey Samad's conflicted state of mind with an assured touch, through acidly surreal fantasy sequences and Samad's frequent entreaties to God. Clever dialogue allows Archie to inadvertently cut through Samad's self-justifying rhetoric with lugubrious common sense, but he lacks the conviction to prevent Samad from dividing his family to cover his shame. The latter episodes focus on the consequences of Samad's actions on the next generation, and apparently minor characters from the opening episodes are brought to the fore, including a fresh-faced James McAvoy (Shameless, The Last King of Scotland, Becoming Jane), as Josh, the bright, hot-housed only child of academic parents who befriends Samad and Archie's children. Geraldine James and Robert Bathurst stop just shy of overplaying, in a bitingly satirical portrayal of well-meaning, ineffectual middle class parents who neglect Josh in favour of a more exotic houseguest.  The broiling resentments created by the elder generation in the opening episodes lead to a riotous climax in which all loose ends are firmly knotted in fantastic, if implausible fashion. Despite this, White Teeth is entertaining and witty enough to make stretching credulity to near breaking point not only forgivable, but an essential part of the story. The latter episodes also reinforce the mythical and fantastic elements of the plot with visual cues--like Samad's adolescent twins, one wears black, the other white, for much of the final episodes. White Teeth is  a timely piece, filled with committed and convincing turns from its cast. It neatly dissects the frictions of a multi-racial and multi-generational society, with a heartening lack of the present paranoia in TV drama, and maintains an affectionate, wonky sensibility.

Architecture School opens a window onto the art and science of architecture while telling a unique and uplifting story about the literal rebuilding of New Orleans.

N.H.S. facilitates the sale of the URBANbuild home, and also provides the capital and land. Tulane provides the creativity, expertise and manpower, in the form of the students themselves. For the students, URBANbuild represents a chance to see their ideas realized at an unusually early stage of their professional careers, not to mention a way to contribute to a city still struggling nearly three years after Hurricane Katrina.

An average man finding it increasingly difficult to put up with the monotony of life, the disappointing marriage, the office grind and the daily commute. Rebellion begins to build in his mind, in the form of increasingly surreal flights of fancy. And, slowly, Reggie begins to say what he really thinks, to his wife, to his boss, to his fellow commuters... and, most dangerously of all, to his new colleague, the beautiful Jasmine Strauss. Executive producer Phil Clarke told Broadcast magazine that this project (Objective's first studio sitcom and its first comedy commission for BBC1) is aiming to deliver an accessible family show for a pre-watershed slot. Martin Clunes plays the lead character, and an impressive cast list including Wendy Craig and Geoffrey Whitehead back him up. Clarke continues: \"Reggie's still a man in crisis with the modern world, but what's interesting is to look at where the world has changed since the 1970s and where it hasn't.

It's time for his toys to rest too. But they have just five minutes more to tell each other a story... Five Minutes More is the perfect antidote to the fast-moving images and loud sounds that compete for a child's attention. We all need quiet moments in the day and this new puppet animation series will draw young viewers into the gentle, wonderful world that the bedspread toys inhabit. This is a land where all sorts of fun and amazing adventures can, and do happen. Georgie, Louisa, Faraway, Florrie and Sam are best friends. Together, this small group of beanie-style toys live on the patchwork bedspread that covers the child's bed. It's a quilt of beautiful fabric pictures - a castle, a boat out at sea, a forest, a snow scene, a strange fantasy planet and more... The toys take it in turns to be the storyteller, while their friends act out the story. We fade into a patchwork picture and find the toys in the land of the imagination. Whether as elephants in the jungle, or adventurers in the snow, the toys play their parts with great gusto and enthusiasm, even if they do sometimes get a little distracted. The stories are original, enchantingly simple, and enriched with music and laughter. The five toys enjoy the same relationships as a typical group of young children. They are firm and devoted friends, always ready for fun and keen to take part in each other's story. But as with any set of friends, the storytelling does not always run as smoothly as they would like. There are numerous distractions, and sometimes the stories take unexpected and comic courses!  Five Minutes More explores the relationship between storyteller and child, rather than presenting a performance for a passive audience. Children, parents and carers alike will recognise Five Minutes More as real-life Story Time - complete with all the usual interruptions, comments and questions!

There are parents who are scared and isolated with problems that they often keep quiet - issues dealing with their children's paranormal abilities. Now, thanks to Medium Chip Coffey and renowned psychologist and Columbia University professor, Dr. Lisa Miller, help is on the way. Each one-hour episode features three kids who ultimately are brought together by Chip and Lisa to learn how to cope with their gifts and to realize they are not alone.  Medium Chip Coffey utilizes both his abilities in the paranormal and his Masters Degree in Psychology when he deals with children who are showing signs of possessing psychic and medium abilities. Chip aims to help the children with the supernatural phenomenon he or she is experiencing: how to manage this lifelong \"gift\" and the burdens that sometimes go along with the paranormal abilities. Dr. Lisa helps the children and families deal with the inter-family conflict they may be experiencing. From seeing dead people to frightening abilities to predict the future, Chip and Lisa will uncover the truths and help the terrified and gifted. In the end, \"Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal,\" is an intense journey of a medium and a psychologist, who draw on their own personal experiences, training, and unique outlook on life to teach troubled kids how to deal with what they often feel is a curse, as much as a unique and special gift.

Its three stories are interwoven, with arcs told from the perspectives of Pakistani growers and manufacturers, German dealers, and British users. The six-part series was produced by Britain's Channel 4, written by Simon Moore, and directed by Alastair Reid. In the United States it was first aired on Masterpiece Theatre in 1990. \"Traffik\" is lauded not only for the quality of its script, its complex, interleaving plots, the brilliant performances of its ensemble cast and its subtle pacing; but also its bold and dispassionate look at the global drugs trade. It does not demonise the victims of heroin - the poor growers of \"harmless\" opium, the mules, the addicts. Nor does it oversentimentalise them. And it manages to humanise the \"evil-doers\" - the gangsters and pushers - in a way which makes the heroin problem seem part of the fabric of society, not some extra-societal force of people committed to \"evil\". Traditional political solutions to heroin trafficking and use are shown in all their ineffectualness. The overall message of the series is that you can never stop the production and supply of drugs like heroin, and that innocent people get hurt by the drug trade. All these qualities were recognised when Traffik was nominated for six BAFTA Awards, winning three. It also won an International Emmy Award for best drama. The plot of Traffik was used as a basis for the 2000 film Traffic. The success of that film led to the production of DVD and VHS versions of the miniseries, still available for sale as of 2006.", "imdb_id": "tt0096716", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/12452-6121246056-2473165975-6294942400-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 12452, "title": "Traffik", "first_aired": "1989-06-22", "runtime": "60"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "", "imdb_id": "tt0497863", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/091414/poster/22280-0-0-0-81074919042-140444046471-37224634591-tv.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 22280, "title": "Northern Lights", "first_aired": "2006-01-16", "runtime": "60"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "This series follows sisters and business partners Sophie LaMontagne and Katherine Kallinis as they run Georgetown Cupcake, a small cupcakery that they've transformed into a sweeping success.", "imdb_id": "tt1687366", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/10160-1705606911-4953128938-4982752488-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 10160, "title": "DC Cupcakes", "first_aired": "2010-07-16", "runtime": "30"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/12472-1732940884-6167622125-507506314-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 12472, "title": "Spoilers with Kevin Smith", "first_aired": "2012-05-21", "runtime": "0"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "Hunt with Odyssey Marine Exploration as they search for the ocean's greatest lost treasures.

Run visits Class 2-4 with her friends the timid, tall and quite busty Yuuko, and the level-headed, glasses-wearing Nagi. Through a series of misunderstandings Tooru sees Yuuko as her rival for Run's affection, and reacts quite violently in her jealousy against Yuuko. Daily life confronts these close friends with all sorts of banal situations, be they in school, in town or at home. But they always pull through... in their own special way.", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/13043-8758107978-1826039590-8870033421-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 13043, "title": "A-Channel", "first_aired": "2011-04-07", "runtime": "25"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/13046-9035936966-5867015934-9209573636-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 13046, "title": "Himawari, Too", "first_aired": "2007-01-20", "runtime": "0"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/13057-5351880919-1107064067-3864441104-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 13057, "title": "La Storia della Arcana Famiglia", "first_aired": "2012-07-31", "runtime": "0"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/13065-8691757749-5757469758-9860417121-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 13065, "title": "Show!

BATTLEGROUND: RHINO WARS, the next evolution in Animal Planet's muscular conservation strand, reveals the conflict among the country's nefarious poachers and South Africa's anti-poaching unit, which has recruited armed forces to stop the illegal, lucrative trade of rhino horns. Cameras unveil the incessant violence and excessive carnage as park rangers are murdered trying to protect the wildlife that's indigenous to their homeland. Four current and former members of the U.S. Special Ops (Navy SEALs and a Green Beret) are brought in to survey the situation, train the anti-poaching corps, exchange tactical information and go on the front lines themselves to help defeat these ruthless criminals before the rhinos are brought to total extinction. BATTLEGROUND: RHINO WARS follows the incessant violence as the team tries to protect the wildlife indigenous to the South African people.", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/14682-722659296-8941962286-9655445069-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 14682, "title": "Battleground: Rhino Wars", "first_aired": "2013-03-07", "runtime": "60"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/14699-4693030873-1899650204-6239289064-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 14699, "title": "Gu-am Heo Jun", "first_aired": "2013-03-17", "runtime": "0"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/14700-1238626414-8359512086-7404070548-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 14700, "title": "Dudley Do-Right (1959)", "first_aired": "1959-11-18", "runtime": "0"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "Life is a journey for Ben Hoffman, and he needs a lot of help navigating it.

Angola is home to 5,300 prisoners who may never see the outside world again. With an army of 1,300 dedicated staff-people, the prison grounds are also home to hundreds of guards and workers and many of these families have dwelled there for generations.  The penitentiary has a bloodied past, known for the numerous grisly murders that occurred there, but Warden Burl Cain has since introduced correctional programs to correspond with his motto - \"Land of New Beginnings.\" The earned opportunity to be released temporarily from the prison walls to train animals outside in fresh air gives Angola inmates the incentive to work hard, stay in line and feel the reward of the closest thing to freedom many of them will ever experience again.  These dangerous criminals, with the harshest and most enduring prison sentences, have a simple choice: Either they rebel and live in despair or they cooperate and earn privileges at Angola. If they can earn the title of \"trustee,\" they are entrusted to do meaningful work, much of it with animals. It can take an inmate 10 years to reach trustee status and become eligible for the most sought-after jobs on the grounds, such as herding cattle, raising bloodhounds and training wild horses. Good behavior also earns the prisoners the chance to compete in Angola's controversial, yet popular annual rodeo where prisoners intermingle with the general public, work with horses and have the potential to earn prize money and acclaim. As one convict says, it's worth being good all year to have just \"eight seconds of freedom\" on the back of a bucking bronco.  \"To the average person, the rodeo may seem non-traditional,\" says Cathy Fontenot, assistant warden of Angola Prison, \"but I have personally seen the transformation of these prisoners since we started moral rehabilitation and expanded on ideas like the rodeo and the trustee program - the improvement is phenomenal.\"   Of course Warden Cain and his employees aren't naive to the possibility of rebellion and escape. At any moment, they're prepared to protect themselves and society from acts of violence, using an army of guards and guard dogs as insurance. In the premiere episode of LOUISIANA LOCKDOWN, the threat of flooding (a likelihood as the prison is surrounded by water), can turn the prison into an escape route. With the Mississippi River nearing historic heights, the warden and his staff face their first-ever evacuation thus risking utter chaos by transporting hardened criminals to institutions across the state.  LOUISIANA LOCKDOWN is a groundbreaking series, providing viewers with exclusive in-depth access to a prison with a fierce reputation and distinctive setup. Despite its numerous safeguards and extreme preparation for the worst-case scenario, Angola is not a place of extreme rigidity. It gives each inmate the control over his fate while serving his sentence and purpose behind working hard.

And he revisits Cambridge University, where both he and Darwin studied, and where many years later the DNA double helix was discovered, providing the foundations for genetics.

We now understand why there are so many different species, and why they are distributed in the way they are.

Maine is one of two states where eel fishing is legal, and it's the state's second largest revenue stream, bringing in approximately $40 million this past year alone! But in this icy New England state, catching this sort of liquid gold is slippery and dangerously fast! It all has to be done within a two-month window, so the fishermen who commit their lives to reeling in the loot (a maximum of 400 can obtain licenses) must endure all sorts of hardship, uncertainty and danger - all compounded by a lack of sleep -to turn eel fishing into COLD RIVER CASH. On Thursday, January 2, at 10PM ET/PT, Animal Planet's COLD RIVER CASH brings viewers eight episodes of adventure and mishaps as three teams of fishermen take to the rocky riverbanks of coastal Maine to vie for an elusive but lucrative catch - baby glass eels - which are tiny cellophane-looking creatures also known as elver eels. During the short two-month season, which begins every March, COLD RIVER CASH's three impassioned competitive teams -the Eelinators, Grinders and Maineiacs-- work round the clock to find prime fishing holes, protect profitable territory and haul in as many eels as possible, which can cash in at a hefty $2,000 a pound. High demand in Asia means the fishermen could earn hundreds of thousands of dollars in a few short months, but with only 60 days to make a year's income, each team is determined to find the most lucrative fishing spot. COLD RIVER CASH features some of the Maine's saltiest characters as they hunt day and night amid high tide and a full moon. Invisible, deep holes, perilous rocks and frigid waters are but a few of these fishermen's natural obstacles. The stakes are high; the rivalry is intense; and the threat of danger is constant as each team struggles to come out ahead.", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/17290-8048520311-6289369678-2088625888-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 17290, "title": "Cold River Cash", "first_aired": "2014-01-02", "runtime": "60"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/17299-1472827401-8679461330-565294186-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 17299, "title": "Chasing Shackleton", "first_aired": "2014-01-03", "runtime": "0"}, {"status": null, "rating": "TV-Y", "overview": "Cute, curious, mischievous, playful can creatures explore and enjoy our world from their very unique point of view.", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/17302-3605166660-5826492170-5990839526-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 17302, "title": "Canimals", "first_aired": "2011-10-10", "runtime": "7"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/17304-9282933548-2318421598-3360888497-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 17304, "title": "20's", "first_aired": "2014-01-06", "runtime": "0"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/17306-5528079290-3089091620-8565529044-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 17306, "title": "The Hours of My Life", "first_aired": "2014-01-08", "runtime": "0"}, {"status": null, "rating": "Not Rated", "overview": "Shio Ogura is a Japanese high school student, who is visiting Taiwan on a school trip when she is suddenly attacked by monsters.

Tetsuya turned himself into an android for the purpose of hunting down and destroying robots that have taken over the world. His biological father, Dr. Kotaro Azuma, was the inventor of the automatons that were originally intended to serve humankind. However, the first android, BK-1, was struck by lightning, and went out of control. With its great strength, it escaped from the castle despite attempts to stop it. After some time, it renamed itself as Buraiking Boss (often mistranslated in English as \"Black King Boss\"; derived from Wu Lai  or burai, meaning rogue or brute), and was able to build a robot army against mankind; the robots mutinied en masse when their cold logic concluded that the good of the Earth Ecosystem required the destruction of the human race.[4] [5]  Casshern and his robotic dog, Friender, join forces with a beautiful girl named Luna Kozuki to battle the robots led by the Buraiking Boss.[6] Casshern has great strength and agility, but he is not armed, except for a pair of odd pistols, used more like rockets than weapons. Friender is capable of transforming itself into a tank or a jet aircraft and actively helps Casshern to fight the robot army. While the robots are huge and robust machines, he is usually able to destroy them with his bare hands, dispatching a great number in any battle. Casshern has also some weakpoints: his body must be re-charged (with solar energy), and cannot sustain very long battles without risking low battery power. Luna was totally harmless, until her father was able to build an electromagnetic pistol, easily capable of destroying the robots. Almost all the robot machines have an antenna on top of their heads, ripping it off usually causes them to blow up, so they are relatively vulnerable.

Among those on board: First Lady Simone Mathany, space-exploration entrepreneur Steve Roebling, Dr. Denise Balaban, pilot Fiona Henslaw, and a very lucky lottery winner. But while en route, a massive solar flare sparks a cosmic-ray burst that accelerates Aurora's engine and blows the ship away from Earth's orbit. Now out of control, it's hurtling straight for the sun. At Mission Control, along with the desperate President Thomas Mathany, an increasingly anxious team of experts puts a plan into motion - an interception by a shuttle attached to the International Space Station. When that ends in disaster, the Aurora only picks up speed. Now being pulled toward the sun at three percent of the speed of light, it's only a matter of hours before it burns. With that, the scalar engine will trigger cosmic ray bursts, and a giant electromagnetic pulse storm that will blow Earth back into the Stone Age.

According to Campbell, by examining the world's diverse mythologies you will find therein universal themes that are applicable and speak directly to all humankind. In Mythos, Campbell dissects a wide range of the world's mythologies, particularly Hinduism and Buddhism. Rather than pointing out their superficial differences, he accentuates and embraces their similarities. It doesn't matter whether the myths are Greek, Indian, Egyptian, Native American, Judeo-Christian, or Arthurian in origin.

As she came from a very distinguished line of jewelery makers in the kingdom, she was assigned the task of making a beautiful headpiece in the shape of a phoenix, inlaid with precious stones and tails made from the feathers of exotic birds for the Empress Dowager. However, during a flower viewing outing, the phoenix headpiece worn by the Empress Dowager suddenly bled tears of blood. Taking this as a sign of bad luck, she threw it away and demanded that the jewelery maker, Choi-king, be punished. She died as a result of the harsh beatings. Before she passed away, she told Sam-ho to always remember the significance of her name, \"Do kind deeds, speak kind words, spread kindness\". (Sam-ho literally means three goodness/kindness). At the same time around Choi-king's death, Lee Yi (Moses Chan), the young prince of Concubine Cheng, met the six years old Sam-ho. He showed kindness to Sam-ho by giving her some white flowers from Choi-king's favorite tree so she could take it to her dying mother. Later when he had to leave the palace without his mother, feigning mentally ill as an excuse to escape the imminent death threat by the Empress Dowager, Sam-ho gave him some sweet 'tong lin-chi', to comfort him on the journey. Because of this, the young prince has developed a good feeling for her. The Imperial Household Bureau was responsible for managing and directing all household services to the Emperor and the Imperial family of the Tang Dynasty. It was made up of four departments, namely the Houses of Jewelery, Attire, Food and Furnishing. Sam-ho and Kam-ling were introduced into the bureau in their childhood and brought up as the disciples in the palace. The two girls were very diligent. Yuen Tsui-wan (Susanna Kwan), Head of the Jewels, and Chung Suet-ha (Michelle Yim), Head of Attire, were both very fond of Sam-ho for she was a kind-hearted young girl and showed great capabilities in the decorative arts of jewelery and silk work. Both of they fough bitterly to have Sam-ho in their departments. In the end, Sam-ho was assigned to Department of Attire while, Kam-Ling was assigned to the Department of Jewelery. Years later, Sam-ho grew up to be a very lovely young lady and she met Ko Hin-yeung (Kevin Cheng) the palace scholar and chess teacher, where a secret love bloomed between them. At the same time the young prince now grown up, Lee Yi, return to the palace and become the Emperor after evading assassinations with the help of Sam-ho and Hin-yeung. He promoted Hin-yeung as the Palace General because of his faithfulness. Sam-ho later become the Head of the Jewel Department. Even though the Emperor has deep feeling for Sam-ho and had wanted to marry Sam-hou, he decided to bury his feeling for her when he discovered that Hin-yeung and Sam-ho loved each other. Sam-ho and Kam-ling continue to enjoy a very close friendship, treating each other as sisters and this provokes jealousy among other palace girl servants. Time and again some of them will try to get Sam-ho and Kam-ling into trouble. However, Kam-ho's honesty and kind attitude endeared many powerful people in the palace to her and they always help her out. Whereas, Kam-ling uses her cunning mind to get rid of her enemies. As time passed, Kam-ling realizes that to stop the bullying and to be able to survive in the palace she has to be someone powerful and respectful. Therefore, she slowly works on a scheme to gain favour of the Empress Dowager Cheng, Lee yi's mother. She was eventually chosen as one of the emperor's concubines.

The stakes are high when a client asks for a signature architectural design. All sorts of challenges stand in the way, from budget issues to site constraints to construction logistics. It's the great buildings, interiors, and landscapes that not only meet these challenges but exceed expectations. Cool Spaces! The Best New Architecture is a TV series developed for public television that profiles these projects and takes the viewer on an up-close and informative tour -- not just of the building, but of the design process itself, from idea to reality.  Cool Spaces! features some of the 21st century's most provocative and innovative public space architecture in North America. Each hour-long episode is organized around a central building typology theme -- such as Performance Spaces or Art Spaces -- and profiles three buildings. Season 1 will consist of eight episodes in 2013: four aired in the spring and four in the autumn.  In each project segment, viewers will learn why something was designed, see how it was designed, and discover just what makes it so cool. Guided by architect and teacher Stephen Chung, we'll set off to explore these exciting designs and decide for ourselves if something really is a \"Cool Space\"!", "imdb_id": "", "artwork": "http://static-api.guidebox.com/012915/shows/posters/19473-8473428278-3239872600-7823429187-600x855.jpg", "downvote_count": 0, "upvote_count": 0, "show_id": 19473, "title": "Cool Spaces", "first_aired": "2014-03-27", "runtime": "60"}, {"status": null, "rating": "TV-MA", "overview": "Angry Kid is a series of stop motion animations from Darren Walsh at Aardman Animations, depicting the mini-adventures of a 15 year old brat with an attitude problem.

It was first aired in the UK in April 2002 and was later broadcast in the U.S. on various PBS stations in 2003 as Manor House, where extra footage was added. In the series the Olliff-Cooper family are given the identities of turn-of-the-century aristocrats and housed in Manderston, an opulent Scottish country house, where they live for three months in the Edwardian style. Mr. and Dr. Olliff-Cooper become Sir John Olliff-Cooper, Bt, and Lady Olliff-Cooper. Interest and conflict is provided by the 14 servants, portrayed by individuals from several walks of life. Chief among these was Hugh Edgar, an architect from Surrey, who was cast in the role of the butler.

In the pilot, members of a girls' competitive dance team are stricken with a strange, psycho-physiological illness that manifests itself in violent fits and spasms and then begins spreading in the community through technology. Neurologist Logan Harlen (played by Mena Suvari) returns to her hometown to investigate the cause. Fighting her own demons and the growing manipulation of a brother on death row, Logan develops an uneasy suspicion that the hysteria surrounding the girls might actually be linked to social media and her own tragic past. Hysteria is written by Shaun Cassidy, who is known for genre thrillers such as Invasion and American Gothic, and directed by Otto Bathurst, who won the BAFTA Award for his work on the critically-acclaimed U.K. mini-series Peaky Blinders. The show also stars James McDaniel (Orange Is The New Black) as \"Carl Sapsi,\" Josh Stewart (The Dark Knight Rises) as \"Ray Ratajeck,\" Adan Canto (X-Men: Days of Future Past) as \"Matt Sanchez,\" Laura San Giacomo (Saving Grace) as \"Grace Pelayo\" and T.R.

The series is based on the extensive research done in 25 trips to Egypt and 51 other countries around the world by Dr. Carmen Boulter in the Graduate Division of Educational Research at the University of Calgary. The Pyramid Code features interviews with prominent scholars and authors in multidisciplinary fields: geology, physics, astrophysics, archaeology, bi-logical engineering, magnetic field theory, hieroglyphics, and Egyptology. The series explores penetrating questions: Who were the ancients and what did they know? Could the pyramids be much older than traditional Egyptology would have us believe?

The nation was founded upon the idea that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The nation would pay a bloody cost for denying that right to more than twelve percent of its population. But when slavery was first brought to America's shores, this war, and even the nation it tore apart, was centuries in the future. With incredibly detailed historical reenactments, expert commentary and the stories of slavery told through first-hand accounts, this is an epic struggle 400 years in the making. A journey into the past like none other. This is the story of these men and women who by their hands laid the foundation of what would become the most powerful nation on Earth.
